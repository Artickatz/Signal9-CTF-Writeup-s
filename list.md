## Misc

### Sanity Check
**10 Points**  
*Author: Samuel Hayden*  
All of the flags in this CTF are in the format s9{flag}, unless otherwise specified. Occasionally, slight modifications may have to be made to the text you find in a challenge to match this format, such as finding the text "s nine example" and converting that to s9{example}. To give you experience in submitting flags, submit the flag for this challenge: s9{$@n1ty_ch3ck}

### Flag Commentary
**75 Points**  
*Author: Samuel Hayden*  
Find the flag hidden within this very challenge box!

### Dashing Forward
**100 Points**  
*Author: Samuel Hayden*  
Our field team received an important message over the radio but we can't decode it, can you help?

### I Love You and I Miss Osu
**100 Points**  
*Author: Kalin Khanzada*  
This audio always resonated within me, just something about this kid's sincerity and broken-heartedness. I love you, and I miss you, Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu, and I'm S9orry that I, yada yada yada, you'll hear it all in this.

### Never
**100 Points**  
*Authors: Samuel Hayden, Jake Crowley*

`nc challenges.signal9.club 27123`

### Go Git The Flag
**250 Points**  
*Author: Jake Crowley*  
The flag is hidden somewhere in this git repository, can you find it?

### Library
**100 Points**  
*Author: Samuel Hayden*  
Hackers are exfiltrating data but we can't make any sense of it whatsoever. We do know that they keep talking about some "Library", and mentioning the passage Genesis 11:1-9. We're clueless, so see if you can use this file to figure this one out.

## OSINT

### Intro to OSINT
**100 Points**  
*Author: Fr3sh_Shr3k*  
We have recently come across Kanye West's phone, but are unable to open it. Do you think you can find his passcode? I'm sure with the amount of time he's in the news, I'm sure there is something out there you can dig up...

### Flag's Gambit Declined (Unlocks Challenge)
**100 Points**  
*Author: Samuel Hayden*  
A new hacker who goes by the handle th3_scr1p7_k1dd13 has gotten really into chess lately, can you find the first flag he hid?

### Wikipedia 0x0
**100 Points**  
*Author: Samuel Hayden*  
Find the flag that was published on [Wikipedia Capture the Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag) sometime during the month of May 2020.

### Wikipedia 0x1
**100 Points**  
*Author: Samuel Hayden*  
We're told the hacker who released the first flag on the Wikipedia page is responsible for discretely leaking a second flag. Try to find it.

## Cryptography

### The Basics 0x0
**50 Points**  
*Author: Artickat*  
We've seen hackers communicating with these strange messages, we don't know what they are, but we believe they may be using a numbering system to encode text. See if you can read the message.  
`01110011 00111001 01111011 00110111 01001000 00110001 00110101 01011111 00110001 00110101 01011111 00110111 01001000 00110011 01011111 01000110 00110001 00110100 00110110 01011111 00110001 01001110 01011111 00111000 00110001 01001110 00110100 01110010 01011001 01111101`

### The Basics 0x1
**50 Points**  
*Author: Samuel Hayden*  
The hackers have seemed to change their encoding scheme, but not their methods. Try to decode what they are saying now:  
`\x73\x39\x7b\x68\x33\x78\x5f\x77\x31\x74\x68\x5f\x74\x68\x33\x5f\x62\x33\x24\x74\x5f\x64\x31\x33\x5f\x31\x31\x6b\x33\x5f\x74\x68\x33\x5f\x72\x33\x24\x74\x7d`

### Ides of March
**50 Points**  
*Author: Shayden*  
This message seems to have some ancient form of encryption applied, try to decode it:  
`v9{Mxolxv_zrqw_eh_kdssb_derxw_wklv}`

### The Basics 0x2
**100 Points**  
We have no clue what the hackers are doing now, there's not even any delimiters! We've heard from an inside source that there is still some type of encoding going on, so see if you can crack this one:  
`czl7MG4xeV90aDNfQkFTRTFjJH0=`

### The Basics 0x3
**100 Points**  
These hackers never seem to learn, they're using an encoding system again! We're not quite sure what it is, but we do know it's not base64. See if you can crack this message as well:  
`OM4XWVZTGEYV65DIIB2F652AGVPTCMZVGVPWENBEGFRS4LROPU======`

### Doesn't make sense, XOR does it?
**100 Points**  
This message was sent along with "\x59", see if you can crack it:  
`\x2a\x60\x22\x01\x69\x0b\x06\x10\x7d\x37\x2d\x06\x19\x06\x3a\x31\x69\x2b\x6a\x24`

### Quite Revolutionary
**100 Points**  
*Author: Fr3sh_Shr3k*  
We have intercepted a message from a patriotic hacker gang, see if you can crack this one. They really seem to love American history...  
`711 235 716 283 548 634 166 625 72 236 4 732 682 683 690 433 708 439 682 683 501`

### Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Decoding
**150 Points**  
*Author: Fr3sh_Shr3k*  
We have intercepted another message from our patriotic hacker gang. We are completely stuck, so how about you have a go at it.  
`Rjx wrp sggbgzg yox zpmdqsk glgxq, Gp. Ywbiwzpsx. Svy jadv vo wknum lqqximxwtvu FxajmcxmmwTnpv zrepvuorflcs.`

### The Basics 0x4
**200 Points**  
The hackers have all but given up! They created one final system to encode messages, but it appears to be all ones and zeros again?!? See if you can figure out what's going on and stop this once and for all:  
"01011100 01111000 00110100 01100011 01011100 01111000 00110101 00110010 01011100 01111000 00110011 00110100 01011100 01111000 00110100 00110100 01011100 01111000 00110100 01100100 01011100 01111000

*Author: Samuel Hayden*
These hacking groups are starting to use modern encryption, we found all the parameters to this RSA encoded text on their recovered hard drive, see if you can decode the message.
p = 13 q = 37 N = 481 r = 432 K = 9073 e = 43 d = 211

### XOR might be a chore...
**300 Points**

### Root Of The Issue
**300 Points**  
*Author: Samuel Hayden*  
It's time to use your knowledge of cryptography to get down to the root of the issue...

### Russian Crib
**500 Points**  
*Author: Samuel Hayden*  
Our spies have uncovered 3 distinct messages from Russian Cyber Operations. We believe these messages are encrypted with a simple XOR operation, and our previous efforts have shown that this threat actor prefaces each message with the plaintext "Товарищи, " translating to "Comrade, ". Each of these raw messages have been encoded in Base64 before being given to you here, so you'll have to undo that before you crack the encryption. We believe this APT is preparing a major attack, and retrieving the password to their operational C2 server could save millions of dollars, or even human lives, good luck. Please submit in the format `s9{PASSWORD}`

### Half-n-Half
**500 Points**  
*Author: Samuel Hayden*  
In an attempt to foil cryptanalysis, I have created the perfect algorithm. The algorithm flips exactly half of the bits in the plaintext at random, never flipping a bit more than once. This ensures that for any bit, there is exactly a 50-50 chance if the bit in the hash correlates to the original. To prove it's complete inability to disclose the original text, I will include 150,000 runs of this algorithm on the same plaintext, along with the generator code. Good luck decrypting what can only be described as pure random chance.

### Custom Encryption
**500 Points**  
*Author: Jake Crowley*  
We've intercepted some communications between members of a hacking group from their IRC. Unfortunately, they seem to be using some encryption algorithm that was custom made by one of the members. Fortunately, we were able to get our hands on it. Analyze it and see if there is any way to recover the plaintext.  
Encrypted message: "24174f2a71637976712c6c77702e2913216d3d53354f2f16731e0b41031f5f67573a6a32732e2876167e4925415d584120491e15002f5c57540d0d11531d5b6b07253d793520493e56035e7b47673f6f4133492a5550095871416c7f64233f3d05003d7820277b2f24152c497577297f7505293f14604f3c4742183e4166497912266c2e1437084f0037196b1131482d16250b1b032d2e1218074b511a056d1758670c103d470f301a066d553a254d1319056d37394a"
